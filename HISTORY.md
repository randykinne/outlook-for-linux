# History

This is a fork of the [IsmaelMartinez teams-for-linux](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux) repo, which was a child fork of the [JamieMagee teams-for-linux](https://github.com/JamieMagee/teams-for-linux) repo, that was itself a fork of [Ivelkov teams-for-linux](https://github.com/ivelkov/teams-for-linux).

Jamie did express his desire to refactor this project in Typescript and to support it, but he has archive the project and Ismael suspects that means he doesn't have the time to support it.

Ismael have tried to contact Ivelkov for a few months but haven't receive any answers.

For that reason, Ismael decided to refork it and fix a few things that where not working. The list has grown since then to support many features and to fix most of the bugs.

I then realized a similar need for an Outlook client for Linux, and created this fork.

To be able to use a few github functionalities, it was decided to unfork the fork [#87](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/87).

The original idea was to let the project die when Microsoft would implement a desktop client for linux, as requested on the [Microsoft Suggestions Forum](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/16911565-linux-client). Microsoft released a linux client on February 13, 2020 ([Download](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app#desktopAppDownloadregion), [Instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/get-clients#linux)).
However, the development of this project continued, as it is suprior on some aspects (screen share able to share single windows, normal window border [#281](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/281#issuecomment-601578412), command-line interface,  and, of course, open-source).

Currently, the project is in a stable condition, and should continue as long as needed. Non stable versions are released as pre-release. 
IsmaelMartinez is not "implementing new features, only fixing issues, but happy to help and [â€¦] accept new PRs" ([351](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/351#issuecomment-626590582)).
